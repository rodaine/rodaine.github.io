I'm a 25-year-old web developer born in Oakland, California, and raised in Orlando, Florida. Currently, I am a full stack engineer with the amazing [Visual Supply Co.][vsco] Previously, I worked with the kick-ass team at [Clark/Nikdel/Powell][cnp] as their back-end developer. 

### Choose Your Weapon! ###

The majority of my experience lies in back-end web technologies and frameworks, specifically PHP (vanilla, WordPress & Laravel), C# (ASP.Net & MVC) and Node. More recently and with increasing regularity, I've also been creating web apps with front-end JavaScript frameworks including Ember and Sencha Touch. 

I love experimenting with new technologies and workflows. Between the torrential flow of articles brought to me by Feedly and the crazy good videos on Tuts+ Premium, I am constantly exposed to the latest and greatest. While the materials are excellent, the only way to learn is by doing. Roll up your sleeves and get dirty!

### Free Time ###

In my time away from code, you can usually find me playing videogames on the PlayStation or PC, watching TV shows on Netflix and Hulu (or CrunchyRoll for anime), or cooking up something new in the kitchen. I try to run daily and love the outdoors; I am an avid camper and really enjoy hiking and rock climbing. Weekends you'll find me hanging out with my friends either watching UF Gators Football or at the bottom of a craft beer.
