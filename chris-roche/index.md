Oakland born and Orlando raised, I am a software engineer at [CrossnoKaye][crossnokaye]. Previously, I worked with the kick-ass teams at [Lyft][lyft], [VSCO][vsco], and [Clark/Nikdel/Powell][cnp].

In my time away from code, you can usually find me playing video games on the PlayStation or PC, watching TV shows on Netflix, Hulu and CrunchyRoll, or cooking up something new in the kitchen. Weekends you'll find me hanging out with my friends at the bottom of a bottle of Malbec.
