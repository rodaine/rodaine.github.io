I'm a 27-year-old software engineer born in Oakland, California, and raised in Orlando, Florida. Currently, I am a lead platform engineer with [VSCO][vsco]. Previously, I worked with the kick-ass team at [Clark/Nikdel/Powell][cnp] as their back-end developer.

The majority of my experience lies in back-end web technologies and frameworks. My languages _du jour_ consist of Go, JavaScript (Node, Ember &amp; front-end), PHP (vanilla, WordPress &amp; Laravel) and C# (ASP.Net &amp; MVC). I love experimenting with new technologies and workflows. Roll up your sleeves and get dirty!

In my time away from code, you can usually find me playing video games on the PlayStation or PC, watching TV shows on Netflix and Hulu (or CrunchyRoll for anime), or cooking up something new in the kitchen. I try to run daily and love the outdoors; I am an avid camper and really enjoy hiking and rock climbing. Weekends you'll find me hanging out with my friends either watching UF Gators Football or at the bottom of a craft beer.
