This _perma_-draft shall serve two purposes. First, it should describe the desired layout of posts. Specifically, the document should describe how and when to use certain markup features, structural components, widgets, and writing style.

<aside><strong>Style Note:</strong> every article should open with a paragraph or two leading into the meat of the article. This should precede any headings in the article. It should <strong>NOT</strong> open with an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> like this as it would appear in the snippet on the list view.</aside>

The second purpose is as an example of most (if not all) of the CSS rules that can exist in an article, which is useful for making sure the layout behaves as expected.

### Headings

The `h1` tag is used by the site title, and the `h2` is reserved for the article title. While it might be an arbitrary rule with <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, an article should still maintain the header hierarchy and **only contain `h3` and smaller headers.** The headers must follow the page hierarchy, cannot skip (eg, an `h4` before an "opening" `h3`) and should not be consecutive without some body content in-between.

The title of a post should capture the main content of the entire article. It is what shows up in the SERP, the title of the html page, in social cards and embeds
