Lacking in dexterity and the patience for practice, I was never any good at magic or slight-of-hand. I compensated – though in a far less glamorous fashion – with math tricks. I'll be first to admit they aren't nearly as popular as doing fancy things with cards and coins (and scarfs, and doves, and …), but when you have a small room of tipsy engineers, strange math can have some pretty entertaining effects.

Drinking with a couple friends recently, we started talking about interesting math facts. It started innocently enough with "zero as a number wasn't discovered for *thousands* of years after humans learned to count." Then, my mind was blown with the unusual series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = - 1/12. I then countered with my two favorites: 0.<span style="text-decoration:overline;">9</span> = 1, and (wait for it) the Monty Hall Problem.
