<aside>However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as <a href="#">Flask</a> did declare.</aside>
					
<p>"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a <b>coffee-pot</b>, Mr. Starbuck; he's coming off to make us our <strong>coffee</strong>, is the Yarman; don't you see that big tin can there alongside of him?&mdash;that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."</p>

<blockquote>Go along with you! It's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He's out of oil, and has come a-begging.<cite>Flask</cite></blockquote>

<h4>Sub heading for the win</h4>

<p>As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, <em>without at all</em> heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to his <i>lamp-feeder</i> and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&ndash;his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to <code>supply</code> the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of <code>Jungfrau</code> or the Virgin.</p>

<p>His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.</p>

<p>Now, the game having risen to <strike>leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of </strike>the Pequod's keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.</p>

<p>Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.</p>

<p>"Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."</p>

<p>As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.</p>

<p>"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.</p>
